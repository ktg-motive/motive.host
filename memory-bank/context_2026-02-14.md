# Session Context — February 14, 2026

## Session 1: Memory System Setup & SMTP/DNS Continuation

**Focus:** Setting up the Claude Code memory system for the motive.host project and continuing SMTP/DNS configuration from yesterday.

### Context from Previous Day (Feb 13)

Yesterday's sessions covered the bulk of the xCloud White Label configuration:
- Created all three client-facing plans (Harbor, Gulf, Horizon) with correct pricing, SKUs, and site limits
- Connected Stripe under MOTIVE DEVELOPMENT, INC.
- Configured brand settings (Sunset Harbor logo, favicon, brand name)
- Pointed custom domain host.motiveai.ai to xCloud portal
- Disabled xCloud built-in landing page (marketing handled by motive.host)
- Designed logo via Midjourney (horizon line variant of the flying M), vectorized in Illustrator
- Finalized Sunset Harbor color palette (Navy, Coral, Amber Gold, Sky Blue, Warm White)

### Completed

- Determined xCloud SMTP configuration values for SendGrid (smtp.sendgrid.net:587, TLS, username "apikey")
- Identified all required DNS records for motive.host: SPF (TXT), DKIM (3 CNAMEs from SendGrid), DMARC (TXT)
- Discovered OpenSRS DNS panel does NOT support CNAME records (only A, AAAA, MX, TXT, Forward, Masked Forward)
- Decision: Stick with OpenSRS for now, but Cloudflare migration is required before DKIM can be configured
- Kai decided transactional email should send from motive.host (not motiveai.ai) for clean brand separation
- Created full memory system: CLAUDE.md, context.md, project-memory.json, daily context, reference files

### Decisions Made

- **Email domain:** All hosting transactional email sends from motive.host (not motiveai.ai)
- **DNS provider:** Will migrate to Cloudflare when ready (not urgent but blocks DKIM)
- **SendGrid API key:** Create a dedicated key for xCloud SMTP, scoped to Mail Send only (don't reuse Learning Editor key)
- **DMARC policy:** Start with p=none to monitor before tightening
- **xCloud landing page:** Disabled. motive.host handles marketing, host.motiveai.ai is portal only.

### Blockers

| ID | Blocker | Impact | Resolution |
|----|---------|--------|------------|
| ~~DNS-001~~ | ~~OpenSRS lacks CNAME support~~ | ~~Cannot add SendGrid DKIM records~~ | **RESOLVED** — OpenSRS does support CNAMEs (earlier note was wrong). Records added directly. |
| ~~DNS-002~~ | ~~SendGrid domain auth not started~~ | ~~No DKIM values to add yet~~ | **RESOLVED** — SendGrid domain auth completed, verified for em7426.motive.host |

---

## Completed (previously listed as next steps)

1. ~~Migrate motive.host DNS from OpenSRS to Cloudflare~~ — **Not needed.** OpenSRS supports CNAMEs. DNS stays on OpenSRS.
2. ~~Run SendGrid domain authentication for motive.host~~ — **Done.** SendGrid account u25174194/wl195, verified em7426.motive.host.
3. ~~Add SPF, DKIM, DMARC records~~ — **Done.** All records added and verified in OpenSRS.
4. ~~Complete xCloud SMTP configuration with SendGrid credentials~~ — **Done.** From address: noreply@motive.host.

## Session 2: Agent Template Customization

**Focus:** Customized all 5 agent templates in `.claude/agents/` for the motive.host project.

### Completed

- Reviewed README.md describing the templated agent system (copied from Kingfisher)
- Filled all `<!-- CUSTOMIZE -->` markers in 4 of 5 agents (architect left generic per README guidance)
- **Developer**: Session init (3-step memory), tech stack (xCloud/Vultr/SendGrid/Stripe/OpenSRS), MCP servers, project structure, user roles
- **Product Manager**: Business context with revenue model/margins, memory system sources, user roles (Kai/Prospect/Client/Referral Partner), domain knowledge, competitive landscape, differentiators
- **Document Writer**: Documentation focus — marketing content, client onboarding, legal (ToS/Privacy/AUP), operational runbooks
- **UI Designer**: Sunset Harbor brand guidelines (full color palette, logo specs, nautical theme, voice/tone), marketing site component targets
- Created `memory-bank/reference/agents.md` quick reference file
- Updated knowledge graph with agent configuration details

## Session 3: Marketing Landing Page — Design & Build

**Focus:** Built the complete motive.host marketing landing page from PRD through design spec through implementation, iterating on visual direction with Kai.

### Design Evolution

1. **V1** — Original Sunset Harbor palette (Coral, Navy, Sky Blue, Warm White). Kai felt it looked too much like a typical SaaS page. Lacked technical confidence.

2. **V2** — Shifted to technical authority direction. Added JetBrains Mono for monospace accents, dot grid/line grid background patterns, spec-sheet pricing cards, status indicators, sharper 4px corners. Replaced Coral CTAs with Gold. Deeper navy background. Much better but colors still not right.

3. **V3 (current)** — Kai provided a gold monochrome logo (#D4AF37) and proposed #1F2329 as primary background with #23272E as card offset. Eliminated all light sections — entire site is now dark palette with tonal shifts between charcoal shades. Final palette:
   - #1F2329 (primary bg) → #272B31 (alternate sections) → #23272E (cards) → #2C3038 (content cards)
   - Gold #D4AF37 for CTAs and accents
   - Cool Slate #8892A0 for secondary text
   - Muted White #E8ECF1 for primary text

### Key Positioning Decision

Kai explicitly shifted away from the original "save money vs competitors" messaging to **premium technical authority**. Motive Hosting is positioned as the premier host on the Gulf Coast — charges more and is worth it. The site should make non-technical people see it and think "these people are wizards." High-end consulting firm energy, not budget hosting.

### Completed

- PRD written and saved to `docs/prd-landing-page.md`
- Design spec written and saved to `docs/design-spec-landing-page.md`
- Complete single-page landing site built at `site/index.html`
- Self-hosted fonts: Playfair Display, Inter, JetBrains Mono in `site/fonts/`
- Gold logo deployed at `site/img/logo-nav.png` (source: `motive_host_logo_image-gold.png`)
- All 8 sections: Nav, Hero, Value Props, Pricing, Features, FAQ, Final CTA, Footer
- Mobile-first responsive, WCAG AA accessible, prefers-reduced-motion support
- All CTAs link to host.motiveai.ai, self-serve signup flow
- No placeholder or mock content — everything is real and shippable
- Kai approved the final design: "I love it. This is great."

### Decisions Made

- **Positioning:** Premium/luxury/technical authority, NOT budget hosting
- **Kai's presence on site:** None. No bio, no photo, no team section. Brand speaks for itself. Kai sells through personal reputation in the community.
- **Conversion flow:** Self-serve. CTAs go to host.motiveai.ai portal. No "Book a call."
- **Pricing on page:** Yes, shown confidently. Three tiers with Gulf as "Popular."
- **Logo:** Gold monochrome (#D4AF37) for marketing site. Original gradient stays on xCloud portal.
- **Background:** #1F2329 dark charcoal, NOT the original navy #1A2744. Fully dark site, no light sections.
- **Card offset:** #23272E for visual separation
- **No social proof section:** No testimonials/quotes until real ones exist
- **AI features:** De-emphasized. Mentioned in Horizon tier, not a brand headline.

### Files Created/Modified

- `docs/prd-landing-page.md` — Product requirements document
- `docs/design-spec-landing-page.md` — UI/UX design specification
- `site/index.html` — Complete landing page (HTML/CSS/JS, ~65KB)
- `site/fonts/JetBrainsMono-Medium.woff2` — Added monospace accent font
- `site/img/logo-nav.png` — Replaced with gold logo

## Session 4: Legal Documents — Terms of Service & Privacy Policy

**Focus:** Drafted complete Terms of Service and Privacy Policy using the General Counsel agent.

### Completed

- Drafted full Terms of Service at `site/terms.html` (15 sections, plain English, inline AUP)
- Drafted full Privacy Policy at `site/privacy.html` (16 sections, CCPA/CPRA baseline)
- Updated `site/index.html` footer links from `/privacy` and `/terms` to `privacy.html` and `terms.html`
- Both documents match the site's dark charcoal design system (same fonts, colors, responsive breakpoints)
- Contracting entity set to Motive AI, LLC (with note that this may change per entity decision)

### Key Legal Provisions

- **Liability:** Capped at 12 months of fees paid; consequential damages excluded
- **Termination:** No early termination fees, cancel anytime with 30-day notice
- **Dispute Resolution:** Binding arbitration via AAA in Baldwin County, AL; class action waiver
- **Uptime:** 99.9% target as "commercially reasonable efforts" — not a hard SLA with penalties
- **Backups:** Weekly/7-day (Harbor), daily/30-day (Gulf & Horizon)
- **Data post-termination:** 30-day export window, then deletion
- **Privacy:** Controller for client account data, processor for client website data
- **Subprocessors disclosed:** Vultr, xCloud, Stripe, SendGrid, OpenSRS
- **Breach notification:** Alabama Data Breach Notification Act compliant (45-day requirement)

### Decisions Made

- **Pricing in docs:** Used live site prices ($99/$179/$249) — may need verification against intended pricing
- **Arbitration:** AAA with Baldwin County venue, class action waiver included
- **Privacy baseline:** CCPA/CPRA from the start (even if thresholds not yet met)
- **No cookies section:** Minimal tracking, DNT honored

### Needs Attorney Review

Both documents are draft-quality and include a notice that they need licensed attorney review before going live. Key areas for attorney attention:
- Arbitration clause enforceability in Alabama
- Class action waiver enforceability
- Liability cap adequacy
- Indemnification scope
- CCPA/CPRA applicability given current scale

## Next Steps

1. Test email delivery via xCloud forgot-password flow
2. ~~Draft Terms of Service and Privacy Policy~~ **DONE**
3. Get attorney review of ToS and Privacy Policy before launch
4. Deploy motive.host to live domain (static site, needs hosting/CDN decision)
5. Resolve PRD open questions (contract terms, migration policy, support hours, uptime SLA, analytics)
6. Add testimonials section when real client quotes are available
7. Update design spec doc to reflect final V3 palette (currently documents V2 spec)
8. Verify pricing consistency: live site shows $99/$179/$249, some docs reference $199/$399 for Gulf/Horizon
