          <h4>Current Plans</h4>
          <p>We offer three service tiers, each billed monthly:</p>
          <table class="legal-table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Plan</th>

                <td>Monthly</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>Full feature details for each Plan are available at <a href="https://motive.host">motive.host</a>.</p>

          <h4>Payment Processing</h4>
          <p>All payments are processed through Stripe, our third-party payment processor. By providing your payment information, you authorize us to charge your payment method on a recurring monthly basis. Motive Hosting does not store your credit card numbers. All payment data is handled directly by Stripe in accordance with PCI-DSS standards.</p>

          <h4>No Setup Fees, No Contracts</h4>
          <p>There are no setup fees and no long-term contracts. All Plans are month-to-month. There are no early termination fees. This is a deliberate choice -- we believe we should earn your business every month.</p>

          <h4>Failed Payments</h4>
          <p>If a payment fails, we will:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Notify you by email within 24 hours of the failed charge</li>
            <li>Retry the payment automatically according to Stripe's retry schedule</li>
            <li>Provide a 7-day grace period during which your Services remain fully active</li>
            <li>Suspend your Services if payment is not resolved within 7 days (your data remains intact)</li>
            <li>Terminate your account and begin the 30-day data export window if payment is not resolved within 30 days of the original failure</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Price Changes</h4>
          <p>We may change our pricing from time to time. If we increase the price of your current Plan, we will give you at least 30 days written notice by email before the new price takes effect. If you do not agree to the new pricing, you may cancel your Plan before the new price takes effect. Continuing to use the Services after a price change constitutes your acceptance of the new pricing.</p>

          <h4>Refunds</h4>
          <p>We do not issue refunds for partial months of service. If you cancel mid-month, your Services will remain active until the end of your current billing period. If Motive Hosting terminates your account without cause, we will issue a pro-rated refund for any unused portion of your current billing period.</p>

          <h4>Plan Changes</h4>
          <p>You may upgrade your Plan at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately, and billing is adjusted on a pro-rated basis for the remainder of your current billing period. Downgrades take effect at the beginning of your next billing period.</p>

        <!-- 5. Service Level Commitments -->
        <section id="uptime" class="legal-section">
          <h2 class="legal-section__title"><span class="legal-section__number">5.</span> Service Level Commitments</h2>

          <h4>Uptime Target</h4>
          <p>We use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain 99.9% uptime for your hosted websites and applications. This target measures availability of our hosting infrastructure and does not constitute a guarantee or a service level agreement (SLA) with financial penalties.</p>

          <div class="legal-callout">
            <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> We take uptime seriously and build our infrastructure for high availability. Our 99.9% target means we aim for less than 8.8 hours of unplanned downtime per year. While we do not offer financial credits for downtime, we are transparent about incidents and work to resolve them as quickly as possible.</p>
          </div>

          <h4>Excluded Downtime</h4>
          <p>The following situations are excluded from uptime calculations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scheduled maintenance (we will provide at least 24 hours notice for planned maintenance and schedule it during low-traffic hours when possible)</li>
            <li>Force majeure events (natural disasters, acts of government, widespread internet outages)</li>
            <li>Issues caused by Client Content, third-party software, or actions taken by the Client</li>
            <li>DNS propagation delays outside our control</li>
            <li>DDoS attacks or other malicious activity targeting your specific site</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Monitoring</h4>
          <p>We monitor all hosted sites and applications 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. When our monitoring detects an issue, our team is notified and begins working on a resolution. We will notify you of any significant service disruption affecting your account.</p>

        <section id="acceptable-use" class="legal-section">

          </ul>

          <h4>Resource Usage</h4>
          <p>Each Plan includes specific resource allocations (storage, bandwidth, email accounts, etc.) as described on our website. If your usage consistently exceeds your Plan's allocations, we will contact you to discuss upgrading to a more appropriate Plan. We will not suspend your account for occasional traffic spikes.</p>

          <h4>Enforcement</h4>
          <p>If we determine that you are violating this Acceptable Use Policy, we may, at our discretion:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Notify you of the violation and request that you remedy it within a reasonable time</li>
            <li>Temporarily restrict or suspend the offending content or functionality</li>
            <li>Suspend your account entirely if the violation is severe or you fail to remedy it</li>
            <li>Terminate your account immediately in cases of illegal activity, CSAM, or activity that threatens the security or stability of our platform</li>
          </ol>
          <p>We prefer to work with clients to resolve issues before resorting to suspension or termination.</p>

          <h4>Backup Restoration</h4>
          <p>If you need to restore your site from a backup, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@motive.host">hello@motive.host</a>. We will work with you to restore the appropriate backup as quickly as possible. There is no additional charge for backup restoration.</p>

          <h4>Limitations</h4>
          <p>While we take every reasonable precaution to ensure backup integrity, backups are provided as a convenience and are not guaranteed. We strongly recommend that you maintain your own independent backups of critical business data. Motive Hosting is not liable for any loss of data resulting from backup failures, corruption, or retention policy expiration.</p>

          <h4>Data Export After Termination</h4>
          <p>After your account is terminated (whether by you or by us), we will retain your data for 30 days. During this period, you may request a full export of your Client Content by contacting us at <a href="mailto:hello@motive.host">hello@motive.host</a>. After the 30-day window, we will permanently delete your data from our systems, including all backups, within a commercially reasonable time frame.</p>

          <h2 class="legal-section__title"><span class="legal-section__number">11.</span> Limitation of Liability</h2>

          <h4>Cap on Liability</h4>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Motive Hosting's total cumulative liability to you for all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will not exceed the total fees you paid to Motive Hosting during the 12 months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>

          <h4>Exclusion of Consequential Damages</h4>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Motive Hosting will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to: loss of profits, revenue, data, business opportunities, or goodwill, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

          <div class="legal-callout">
            <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> If something goes wrong with our service, the most we can be held responsible for is what you have paid us over the past year. We are not responsible for downstream business losses like lost sales, missed opportunities, or damage to your reputation. This is standard in hosting agreements and reflects the reality that hosting fees are a small fraction of the value a business generates from its online presence.</p>
          </div>

          <h4>No Warranty</h4>
          <p>The Services are provided "as is" and "as available." To the maximum extent permitted by law, Motive Hosting disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure.</p>

          <h4>Exceptions</h4>
          <p>Nothing in this section limits our liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence; (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any liability that cannot be excluded or limited by applicable law.</p>

          <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Motive Hosting, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your Client Content, including any claims that your content infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party</li>
            <li>Your violation of these Terms or the Acceptable Use Policy</li>
            <li>Your violation of any applicable law or regulation</li>

          <h2 class="legal-section__title"><span class="legal-section__number">13.</span> Dispute Resolution</h2>

          <h4>Informal Resolution</h4>
          <p>Before initiating any formal dispute resolution process, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@motive.host">hello@motive.host</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We will make a good-faith effort to address your concerns within 30 days.</p>

          <h4>Binding Arbitration</h4>
          <p>If we cannot resolve a dispute informally within 30 days, either party may elect to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in Baldwin County, Alabama. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

          <h4>Exceptions to Arbitration</h4>
          <p>Either party may bring a claim in small claims court if the claim qualifies. Either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's intellectual property rights or confidential information.</p>

          <h4>Class Action Waiver</h4>
          <p>You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be void.</p>

          <h4>Governing Law & Venue</h4>
          <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Alabama, without regard to its conflict-of-laws principles. For any claims not subject to arbitration, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Baldwin County, Alabama.</p>

          </ul>
          <p>If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you may cancel your account before the changes take effect. Continuing to use the Services after the effective date of revised Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changes.</p>
          <p>Non-material changes (such as fixing typographical errors or clarifying language without changing meaning) may be made without advance notice.</p>

          <h4>Severability</h4>
          <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, or if it cannot be modified, it will be severed from these Terms. The remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

          <h4>Waiver</h4>
          <p>Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or our right to enforce it in the future.</p>

          <h4>Assignment</h4>
          <p>You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent.

          <h4>Force Majeure</h4>
          <p>Neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations (other than payment obligations) due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to: natural disasters, pandemics, acts of government, war, terrorism, widespread internet or power outages, or labor disputes.</p>

          <h4>Notices</h4>
